    <P><strong><mark>***Breaking News: AlphaGo has won the first two matches!***</mark></strong><br>
      In this, the third in our series on the epic Go matches being played between AlphaGo
      (Google’s Artificial Intelligence software) and Lee Se-Dol (Current Go World Champion),
      we look at the history of Humans vs. Machines, and the innovations that have led us to this incredible moment in time.</p>
<p>For as long as humans have built things, we’ve wrestled with the implications of what we’ve built.
  In many cases, these philosophical and ethical wrestlings have made for great drama—think Frankenstein, or 2001: A Space Odyssey.
  Often, the hypothetical scenarios we envision come remarkably close to true, and the discoveries we’ve made in the fields of
  Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning make clear that a “computer with a mind of its own”
  is going to take over the world not such a fantastic thing to imagine any longer.</p>
